SQL_Project_Repository: Database Analysis & Query Exploration 🗄️
This project works with a structured relational dataset drawn from real-world sources, featuring tables of entities, relationships, and key performance metrics. 📋
The data is used to examine business-relevant questions about patterns, aggregations, and insights, providing a foundation for database-driven decision support and analytical queries.
The notebook and SQL scripts guide you through a series of targeted queries: 🔍
What are the counts and distributions across primary tables (e.g., users, transactions, items)?
How do key metrics vary by category, time period or other grouping?
Which entities show the top performance by one metric and how do they compare by another?
How can joins and aggregations be used to uncover multi-table insights and trends?
Each step builds in complexity, culminating in a final section that synthesises insights and identifies the standout records—the ones that offer optimal combinations of metrics, efficiency and outcome. 🌟
